In this notebook, I will show an example of hypothesis testing to determine if Apple Store receives better reviews than Google Play and if those reviews are statistically significant.

We will use the data downloaded from here to analyze reviews made by users in different apps available in Google Play and Apple Store. I will use a basic Data Science Pipeline that will include:

- [x] Data intake (sourcing and loading)
- [x] Data processing and cleaning (ETL)
- [x] Statistical Modeling
- [x] Evaluation and Conclusion

Results:

The user's review means of 4.049697 and 4.191757 (Apple and Google respectively) don't **seem** all that different! Perhaps, with this result we can assume that: there's no significant difference between Google Play app reviews and Apple Store app reviews. We have an ***observed difference*** here: which is simply (4.191757 - 4.049697) = 0.14206. However, is this result statistically significant?

Dive into this notebook to find out!
